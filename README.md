# Traffic-Lights
Concurrent traffic light simulation to demonstrate safe multi-threading where clients can interact with the server through a proxy.

Requirements of the system:
 - Create a client application to connect to a server through a proxy.
 - Client can add new cars into the system.
 - If any given traffic light has x cars waiting, server must change light to green (from red).
 
Extra features of the implemented system:
 - A full GUI (animations of cars passing lights).
 - Taken advantage of an effective routing algorithm for the cars (A*).
 - Multi-client support.
