# Traffic-Lights
Concurrent traffic light simulation to demonstrate safe multi-threading where a client can interact with a server through a proxy.

Requirements of the system:
 - Create a client application to a server via a proxy.
 - Client can add / remove cars into the system.
 - If any given traffic light has 10 cars waiting, server must change light to green (from red).
 
 Extra features of the implemented system:
  - A full GUI (animations of cars passing lights).
  - Taken advantage of an effective routing algorithm for the cars (A*).
  - Multi-client support.
